# Build record

Source plan: `docs/2026-10-18-maintenance-workflow.md`.

## Decisions

- The user approved building the supplied specification and creating/pushing a new repository. The new local repository is `maintenance-workflow-engine`, beside the source folder. The GitHub repository defaults to private. This new repository is the isolated workspace; no existing implementation is being changed.
- Execute the supplied 13-task plan inline, with test-first checks, focused commits and one fresh final review. The existing specification and plan are retained rather than replaced.
- Ruling: unresolved ambiguity after the final allowed submission ends in `NEEDS_REVIEW`, even after `NOT_FOUND`. A late external commit remains possible.
- Ruling: lookup returns a confirmed stored outcome that distinguishes `CONFIRMED` and `SKIPPED`. Reconciliation must preserve a stock-shortage skip.
- Ruling: Redis-down readiness returns HTTP 200 with `status=degraded` and `broker=false`; Mongo-down readiness returns 503. Admission depends only on MongoDB.
- Real-model inference requires an approved local resource or provider budget. Offline tests must not spend inference credits.

## Interface preflight

| Tasks | Shared contract | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 → 2–9 | Workflow, events, lease, typed plan | Domain owns state legality; store owns concurrency. |
| 2 → 7/11 | Planner and compiled plan | Schema validation and authorization remain independent of provider. |
| 3 → 6–9 | Store save/claim/due work | Conditional field updates preserve lease and dispatch metadata. |
| 4 → 5/9 | Submit/lookup | Lookup retains stored skipped outcomes; same-key replay only. |
| 5/6 → 7/9 | Gateway and wakeup | One mutation per tick; message contains no trusted action arguments. |
| 7/8 → 10–13 | Runner and HTTP | Durable approval and admission precede dispatch. |

## Progress

- [x] 1. Domain and offline package. Missing-package RED, then 10 tests passed; CLI help works offline. Python 3.12.16, exact dependencies in `uv.lock`.
- [x] 2. Catalog policy and fixture planner. Missing-module RED, then full suite 27 passed. Grammar and two-tenant catalog documented.
- [x] 3. MongoDB store and fake. Missing-module RED, fake contracts passed locally. Real MongoDB admission, claim, stale-token and enqueue tests passed in GitHub Actions run 40521208198.
- [x] 4. SQLite-backed external simulators. Missing-module RED, then 33 passed / 2 MongoDB skips. Concurrent same-key submissions, stock skip, persisted restart lookup, payload conflict and post-commit failure covered. Test setup uses independent temporary files.
- [x] 5. Typed HTTP gateways. Missing-module RED; simulator contracts and real subprocess HTTP timeout-after-commit test passed. Lookup recovered the original effect without a duplicate.
- [x] 6. Redis Streams and dispatcher. Offline publish-loss recovery passed locally; real stream pending reclamation and recreation passed in GitHub Actions run 40521208198. Full process fault matrix is tracked under Task 12.
- [x] 7. Leased runner. RED then 46 passed locally, with service tests explicitly skipped there. Real-store/simulator happy path passed in GitHub Actions run 40521208198.
- [ ] 8. HTTP admission/status/approval/cancellation written. RED then 49 passed / 4 service skips. Auth, tenant isolation, body limits, replayed approval, active-lease cancellation and partial-effect cancellation passed. Real-store race checks pending.
- [x] 9. Recovery. Eight expected RED failures, then local recovery tests passed. GitHub run 40523526226 additionally passed abrupt worker termination before/after effects, stale leases, same-key replay and bounded review outcomes across the full fault matrix.
- [x] 10. CLI processes and pinned Compose deployment. GitHub Actions run 40521208198 built and ran the isolated Compose stack and verified workflow completion after worker restart. Image digests are verified by that run; local Docker remains unavailable.
- [ ] 11. OpenAI-compatible planner, strict post-validation and 40/80 synthetic splits implemented. 66 passed / 4 service skips before Compose test addition. No live inference run; label human review and approved inference budget remain required.
- [x] 12. Full 20×10 fault matrix passed in GitHub run 40523526226 at df98593: 200 exact expected states/effect counts, including 20 expected-review runs and 150 automatic completions. All per-case evidence is retained in its fault-evidence artifact; measured summary is checked in.
- [ ] 13. Redacted logging, report tools, demo, docs and CI implemented. Latest local suite: 76 passed, 25 explicit external-service skips. Runtime reconnect logging regression reproduced and fixed. First load run exceeded its 900-second harness deadline; logs established the specified five-second republish cadence. Ruling: increase benchmark-only deadline to 2,400 seconds and retain an append-only observation journal; do not alter scheduling or hide the failed run. Final review and complete measured load are pending.
